description: "God \"was once as one of us\" and \"all the spirits that God ever sent into the world\" were likewise \"susceptible of enlargement.\" Joseph Smith preached that long before the world was formed, God found \"himself in the midst\" of these beings and \"saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself\" and be \"exalted\" with Him."
