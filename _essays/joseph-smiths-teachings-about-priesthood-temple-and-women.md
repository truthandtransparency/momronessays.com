description: "During the 19th century, women frequently blessed the sick by the prayer of faith, and many women received priesthood blessings promising that they would have the gift of healing. \"I have seen many demonstrations of the power and blessing of God through the administration of the sisters,\" testified Elizabeth Ann Smith Whitney, who was, by her own account, blessed by Joseph Smith to exercise this gift. In reference to these healing blessings, Relief Society general president Eliza R. Snow explained in 1883, \"Women can administer in the name of JESUS, but not by virtue of the Priesthood.\""
