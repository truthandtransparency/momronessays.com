title: Plural Marriage (Polygamy) in Kirtland and Nauvoo 
name: plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo
date: 2014-10-22 
description: When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends additional messengers to encourage His people to obey. Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834 and 1842 and commanded him to proceed with plural marriage when he hesitated to move forward. During the third and final appearance, the angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.
